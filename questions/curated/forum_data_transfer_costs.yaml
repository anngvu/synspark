  **Monitoring and Managing Data Transfer Costs in Synapse**

  Large datasets in Synapse can generate significant data transfer costs when heavily accessed. Understanding download patterns and implementing appropriate access controls helps organizations manage these expenses while maintaining data accessibility.
question: "Linda, a data manager, discovers that her organization's 8TB dataset project generated $12,000 in unexpected data transfer costs in one month - representing 40 times the dataset size in downloads. The project was recently made anonymously accessible under a managed plan. What are the most relevant actions to control these costs?"
answers:
  - text: "Move the dataset to AWS Open Data if possible."
    correct: true
    message: "Correct! This solution has been implemented for datasets in the past, but won't be immediate. Restricting dataset access to registered users is still needed."
    points: 1
  - text: "Immediately restrict the dataset to registered users only to prevent anonymous bulk downloads"
    correct: true
    message: "Correct! Anonymous access enables unrestricted downloading, which can lead to excessive costs. Requiring registration provides accountability and allows for usage monitoring and potential download limits."

  - text: "Move the dataset to a lower-cost storage tier to reduce per-GB transfer charges"
    correct: false
    message: "Storage tier changes don't affect data transfer costs, which are charged per GB downloaded regardless of where the data is stored."

  - text: "Implement CloudFront CDN caching to reduce future transfer costs"
    correct: false
    message: "While CloudFront can help with costs, the issue is excessive usage volume, not transfer efficiency."
    points: 0
  - text: "Compress all files in the dataset to reduce download sizes"
    correct: false
    message: "File compression doesn't address the root cause of excessive download volume. If users need the data, they'll still download the compressed files."
