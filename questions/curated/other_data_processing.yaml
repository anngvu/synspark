  **Data Security in Automated Workflows with Synapse**
  
  When building data processing pipelines that work with Synapse data, consider the available options and which environments are appropriate for different types of data and processing.

question: |
  "Rachel, a data engineer, needs to support the project and stakeholders by automating processing of Synapse data in two different tasks: 
  1) create a weekly automation that takes under 10 minutes to query several tables, generate a summary report, and email it to stakeholders. 
  2) for newly added raw whole genome sequence (WGS) data, run the sarek pipeline to call somatic variants - this involves complex multi-step processing that can take several hours.
  What Sage processing environments are most suited for each of these tasks?"

answers:
  - text: "Both tasks are recommended for Sage's nextflow infrastructure only."
    correct: false
    message: "Not true. The first task has simpler requirements and other options available."
    points: 0
  - text: "Both tasks are recommended for Sage's Service Catalog infrastructure only."
    correct: false
    message: "Not true. The second task involves complex genomics processing that is better suited for nextflow infrastructure."
    points: 0
  - text: "The first task recommends Sage's nextflow infrastructure, while the second task is most appropriate for Sage's Service Catalog infrastructure (Scheduled Jobs)."
    correct: false
    message: "The suggested environments are reversed - consider the complexity and duration of each task."

  - text: "The first task recommends Sage's Service Catalog infrastructure (Scheduled Jobs), while the second task is most appropriate for Sage's nextflow infrastructure."
    correct: true
    message: "Correct! For the first task, Scheduled Jobs is ideal for simple, time-limited weekly automations. For the second task, complex genomics pipelines like sarek are already available on Sage's nextflow infrastructure with utilities for data staging and indexing results back to Synapse."
    points: 1
  - text: "Both tasks can be run equally well on either Sage's Service Catalog or nextflow infrastructure."
    correct: false
    message: "Incorrect. These tasks have different requirements that make specific environments more appropriate for each."
