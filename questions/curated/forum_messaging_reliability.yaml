  **Synapse Messaging System**

  Synapse provides a messaging API that allows programmatic sending of notifications to users, commonly used in challenge evaluation pipelines. Understanding the factors that can affect message delivery is important for reliable automated communications.
question: "Jenny is a challenge coordinator running an automated evaluation pipeline that sends status emails to participants using Synapse's sendMessage API. She notices that some emails with subjects like 'Evaluation Failed: 9755203' are not being delivered, while others like 'Evaluation Failed: 9755202' work fine. The API calls return success responses in both cases. What's the most likely explanation for this inconsistent delivery?"
answers:
  - text: "The participants have email filters blocking messages with specific submission IDs"
    correct: false
    message: "While user-side filtering is possible, the pattern suggests a systematic issue rather than individual user configurations affecting specific message IDs."
    points: 0
  - text: "There's an internal anti-spam mechanism in Synapse's messaging infrastructure that may cache or limit similar message subjects"
    correct: true
    message: "Correct! A 2025 discussion reveals that internal spam prevention logic can sometimes affect delivery based on subject patterns, even when the API returns success responses."

  - text: "The message body content is causing the delivery failure, not the subject line"
    correct: false
    message: "The examples show the same message body being used across different subjects, with subject being the main variable affecting delivery."

  - text: "The API rate limiting is preventing consecutive messages from being sent"
    correct: false
    message: "Rate limiting would typically return error responses, not success responses with failed delivery."
