  **Understanding ACLs and Access Requirements in Synapse**
  
  Synapse uses two distinct mechanisms to control data access: Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Access Requirements (ARs). How these work can often cause confusion when troubleshooting access issues.

question: "Maya, a researcher with admin access to her project, is confused because she can't access some files that her team members uploaded (and because it is a large project, there is nearly 100 folders and thousands of files). Within the same project, she can download some files but gets 'access denied' errors for others. Some files that she can't access have Access Requirements, which were applied when the dataset was publicly released. Inexplicably, other inaccessible files *don't* have Access Requirements. What can explain Maya being unable to access these files despite her admin permissions on the project?"

answers:
  - text: "There is likely a system bug with Maya's project admin access since it should give her global access to all of the project and override all access restrictions"
    correct: false
    message: "Admin permissions don't automatically bypass Access Requirements. ARs are a separate governance layer that applies even to users with admin ACL permissions. Also, look into new ACLs created with local sharing settings."
    points: 0
  - text: "Maya hasn't completed the Access Requirements approval process for the publicly released dataset"
    correct: true
    message: "Correct even if inconvenient! Access Requirements operate independently from ACL permissions. Even with admin access, Maya must still fulfill the Access Requirements (like signing agreements, providing justification, etc.) that were applied when the dataset was released."
    points: 1
  - text: "The files that Maya can't access, whether having Access Requirements or not, are corrupted or have different storage permissions"
    correct: false
    message: "This isn't a storage or file integrity issue."
    points: 0
  - text: "There are folders or files with local sharing settings where Maya has no download access."
    correct: true
    message: "Yes, local sharing settings create and apply new Access Control Lists. Since the local ACL replaces the higher-level project ACL where Maya is admin, this explains Maya's inability to access the files with no ARs."

  - text: "Maya's admin permissions has expired and need to be renewed by the project creator"
    correct: false
    message: "If Maya's admin permissions had expired, she wouldn't be able to access any files in the project at all. The issue relates to nuances in Access Requirements and ACL permissions."
